This is the code I used to create a morphogenesis animation

The main script **diffusion.py** will save images of the simulation. This script is inspired by the work of **Karl Sims** http://karlsims.com/rd.html

Then to make the video I used the code from https://theailearner.com/2018/10/15/creating-video-from-images-using-opencv-python/
run **videos.py**

if you want to change the color use the option cmap in plt.imsave() 
You will find the colormaps here : https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html

Enjoy
